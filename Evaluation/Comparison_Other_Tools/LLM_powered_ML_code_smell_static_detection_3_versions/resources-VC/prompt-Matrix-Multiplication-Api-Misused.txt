### CODE SMELL DESCRIPTION

When the multiply operation is performed on two-dimensional matrixes, use np.matmul() instead of np.dot() in NumPy for better semantics.
#### Context
When the multiply operation is performed on twodimensional matrixes, np.matmul() and np.dot() give the same result, which is a matrix.
#### Problem
In mathematics, the result of the dot product is expected to be a scalar rather than a vector (39). The np.dot() returns a new matrix for two-dimensional matrixes multiplication, which does not match with its mathematics semantics. Developers sometimes use np.dot() in scenarios where it is not supposed to, e.g., twodimensional multiplication.
#### Solution
When the multiply operation is performed on twodimensional matrixes, np.matmul() is preferred over np.dot() for its clear semantic (34)(35).

### DETECTION METHODOLOGY

1.  Check if `numpy` is imported.
    
    -   `import numpy as np`
        
    -   `from numpy import ...`
        
2.  If NumPy is imported:
    
    -   Search for any usage of `np.dot()`.
        
3.  When `np.dot()` is used:
    
    -   Check if both operands are two-dimensional arrays (`ndim == 2`).
        
4.  If both operands are 2D, mark as Matrix Multiplication API Misused.
    
5.  Expected alternative: use `np.matmul()` instead for 2D matrix multiplication.
    
6.  If NumPy is not imported, skip checking.

### INSTRUCTIONS
Identify all instances of the Matrix Multiplication Api Misused code smell in the code file using the detection methodology above.

---

### OUTPUT FORMAT

You must return all the instances of the Matrix Multiplication Api Misused code smell found as a json array of string. The json array contains the complete code line of each instance (each exactly as it is in the code).

Something like this:

"instances": [
    {
        "code": "np.dot(a, b)",
        "line": 33
    }
]

Respond with only the json array of the instances and of their corresponding lines (line number). Do not return anything else, not even an emoji or an okay. Return only the json array. Make sure you give a valid json array with no comments in it.

If no instance is found, return a json array like this : []
