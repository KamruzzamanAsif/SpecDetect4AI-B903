# Smell: “Broadcasting Feature Not Used”

## Motivation  
`tf.tile()` creates a real, duplicated copy of a tensor.  
In most situations the same result can be obtained through TensorFlow’s
built-in broadcasting, which keeps only a *virtual* copy and therefore saves
memory and time.  
Whenever `tf.tile()` shows up, the code should be reviewed to see whether a
simpler broadcasted expression would be sufficient.

## Detection strategy (conceptual view)

1. **AST conversion**  
   The source file is first parsed into Python’s Abstract Syntax Tree so we can
   reason on its structure rather than text.

2. **One pass through the tree**  
   While visiting each node we focus exclusively on *function-call* nodes
   (`Call` in the AST terminology).

3. **Pattern matching**  
   For every call we check two properties:  
   • the object on which the call is performed is the identifier `tf`  
   • the invoked function is named `tile`  
   When both conditions hold, the node is considered an explicit tiling
   operation.

4. **Reporting**  
   The line number attached to the offending node is stored and later returned
   to the user so that the exact location of the smell can be inspected.

## What the warning means in practice  
A report indicates:  
“*This line duplicates a tensor explicitly; consider rewriting the operation so
that broadcasting does the job automatically.*”

## Scope and limitations  
• The rule recognises the common alias `tf`; other aliases (e.g., `import tensorflow as t`) are not caught.  
• It does not prove that broadcasting is always possible, only that manual
  tiling is present and might be unnecessary.  
• Other duplication patterns (`tf.concat` in a loop, etc.) are handled by
  separate rules.
