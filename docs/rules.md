### Detection Categories

- **1 Easily detectable statically**: Detectable through static patterns (e.g., AST traversal, syntactic rules). Includes API misuses, explicit constructs, and default values.
- **2 Implicit configuration or dynamic behavior**: Involves logic spread across functions or configuration not directly visible. Requires interprocedural analysis or contextual understanding.
- **3 Static detection insufficient**: Requires dynamic or hybrid analysis. Often relies on runtime behavior, data flow, or execution context.

---

In practice, static detection offers **a sound approximation** of these smells, though **dynamic or hybrid analysis** would improve precision.

Overall, SpecDetect4AI demonstrates that a wide range of AI-specific code smells — including those traditionally seen as dynamic — can be **effectively approximated via static analysis**, thanks to designed detection rules and interprocedural reasoning.
