### CODE SMELL DESCRIPTION

Use self.net() in PyTorch to forward the input to the network instead of self.net.forward().
#### Context
Both self.net() and self.net.forward() can be used to forward the input into the network in PyTorch.
#### Problem
In PyTorch, self.net() and self.net.forward() are not identical. The self.net() also deals with all the register hooks, which would not be considered when calling the plain .forward() (5).
#### Solution
It is recommended to use self.net() rather than self.net.forward().

### DETECTION METHODOLOGY

1.  Check if `torch` is imported.
    
2.  If PyTorch is imported:
    
    2.1 Search for calls to:
    
    -   `.forward(...)` directly on a `nn.Module` subclass (e.g., `self.net.forward(...)`, `net.forward(...)`)
        
3.  If `.forward(...)` is used instead of calling the model directly (e.g., `net(...)`):
    

-   Mark as PyTorch Call Method Misused.
    

4.  If none of these patterns are found, or if PyTorch is not imported:
    

-   Skip this check.

### INSTRUCTIONS
Identify all instances of the Pytorch Call Method Misused code smell in the code file using the detection methodology above.

---

### OUTPUT FORMAT

You must return all the instances of the Pytorch Call Method Misused code smell found as a json array of string. The json array contains the complete code line of each instance (each exactly as it is in the code).

Something like this:

"instances": [
"x = self.pool.forward(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))"
]

Respond with only the json array of the instances. Do not return anything else, not even an emoji or an okay. Return only the json array. Make sure you give a valid json array with no comments in it.

If no instance is found, return a json array like this : []
