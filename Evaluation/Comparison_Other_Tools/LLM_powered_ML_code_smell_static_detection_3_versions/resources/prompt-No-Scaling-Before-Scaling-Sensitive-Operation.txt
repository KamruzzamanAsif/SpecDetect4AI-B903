### CODE SMELL DESCRIPTION

Check whether feature scaling is added before scaling-sensitive operations.
#### Context
Feature scaling is a method of aligning features from various value ranges to the same range (18).
#### Problem
There are many operations sensitive to feature scaling, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Multi-layer Perceptron classifier and L1 and L2 regularization (2)(16). Missing scaling can lead to a wrong conclusion. For example, if one variable is on a larger scale than another, it will dominate the PCA procedure. Therefore, PCA without feature scaling can produce a wrong principal component result.
#### Solution
To avoid bugs, whether feature scaling is added before scaling-sensitive operations should be checked.

### DETECTION METHODOLOGY

1.  Check if `scikit-learn` (sklearn) is imported.
    
    -   `import sklearn`
        
    -   or `from sklearn import ...`
        
2.  Search for usage of scaling-sensitive operations:
    
    -   `PCA()`
        
    -   `SVC()`
        
    -   `SGDClassifier()`
        
    -   `SGDRegressor()`
        
    -   `MLPClassifier()`
        
    -   `MLPRegressor()`
        
    -   `Ridge()`
        
    -   `Lasso()`
        
    -   `ElasticNet()`
        
3.  For each of these:
    
    -   Check if a scaler (`StandardScaler()`, `MinMaxScaler()`, `RobustScaler()`, `Normalizer()`, etc.) is applied before the sensitive operation.
        
    -   Typically this is done through a `Pipeline()` or manual preprocessing.
        
4.  If no scaling is done before, mark as No Scaling Before Scaling-sensitive Operation.
    
5.  If scikit-learn is not imported, skip the check.

### INSTRUCTIONS
Identify all instances of the No Scaling Before Scaling Sensitive Operation code smell in the code file using the detection methodology above.

---

### OUTPUT FORMAT

You must return all the instances of the No Scaling Before Scaling Sensitive Operation code smell found as a json array of string. The json array contains the complete code line of each instance (each exactly as it is in the code).

Something like this:

"instances": [
"clf = make_pipeline(PCA(n_components=2), GaussianNB())",
"clf = SVC()"
]

Respond with only the json array of the instances. Do not return anything else, not even an emoji or an okay. Return only the json array. Make sure you give a valid json array with no comments in it.

If no instance is found, return a json array like this : []
