### CODE SMELL DESCRIPTION

When a new empty column is needed in a DataFrame in Pandas, use the NaN value in Numpy instead of using zeros or empty strings.
#### Context
Developers may need a new empty column in DataFrame.
#### Problem
If they use zeros or empty strings to initialize a new empty column in Pandas, the ability to use methods such as .isnull() or .notnull() is retained (7). This might also happens to initializations in other data structure or libraries.
#### Solution
Use NaN value (e.g. “np.nan”) if a new empty column in a DataFrame is needed. Do not use “filler values” such as zeros or empty strings.

### DETECTION METHODOLOGY

1.  Check if `pandas`, `polars`, `dask.dataframe`, `vaex`, `sklearn.datasets`, or `pyspark.pandas` is imported.
    
    -   `import pandas as pd`
        
    -   `from pandas import ...`
        
2.  If Pandas is imported:
    
    -   Search for new column creation like:
        
        -   `df['column_name'] = 0`
            
        -   `df['column_name'] = ''`
            
        -   `df['column_name'] = some_constant_value`
            
        -   `df['column_name'] = [0, 0, 0]` (constant lists) _(more rare but possible)_
        
        Any empty initialization of new columns.
            
3.  If a constant (0, "", fixed value) is assigned to a whole new column, suspect Empty Column Misinitialization.
    
4.  Distinguish cases:
    
    -   If the column is meant to be filled immediately after with real values → OK (no smell).
        
    -   If the column is meant to be "empty" initially, NaN or pd.Series(dtype=...) should have been used → code smell present.

### INSTRUCTIONS
Identify all instances of the Empty Column Misinitialization code smell in the code file using the detection methodology above.

---

### OUTPUT FORMAT

You must return all the instances of the Empty Column Misinitialization code smell found as a json array of string. The json array contains the complete code line of each instance.

Something like this:

"instances": [
"df['new_col_int'] = 0",
"df['new_col_str'] = ''"
]

Respond with only the json array of the instances. Do not return anything else, not even an emoji or an okay. Return only the json array. Make sure you give a valid json array with no comments in it.

If no instance is found, return an empty json array like this : []
