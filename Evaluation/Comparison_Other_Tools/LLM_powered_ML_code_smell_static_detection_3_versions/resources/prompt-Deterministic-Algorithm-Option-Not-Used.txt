### CODE SMELL DESCRIPTION

Set deterministic algorithm option to True during the development process, and use the option that provides better performance in the production.
#### Context
Using deterministic algorithms can improve reproducibility.
#### Problem
The non-deterministic algorithm cannot produce repeatable results, which is inconvenient for debugging.
#### Solution
Some libraries provide APIs for developers to use the deterministic algorithm. In PyTorch, it is suggested to set torch.use_-deterministic_algorithms(True) when debugging (9). However, the application will perform slower if this option is set, so it is suggested not to use it in the deployment stage.

### DETECTION METHODOLOGY

1.  Check if any of these libraries is imported:
    
    -   `torch` (PyTorch)

    -   `tensorflow`

2.  If PyTorch is imported:

    2.1 Before any model training (`model.forward()`, `loss.backward()`, `optimizer.step()`, or any training loop):

    -   Search if:

        -   `torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)` is called.


    If not set to `True` before training starts, mark as Deterministic Algorithm Option Not Used.

3.  If TensorFlow is imported:

    3.1 Before any model training (`model.fit()`, `GradientTape` manual training loops, etc.):

    -   Search if:

        -   `tf.config.experimental.enable_op_determinism()` is called.


    If not called before training, mark as Deterministic Algorithm Option Not Used.

4.  If none of these libraries are imported:

-   Skip this check.

### INSTRUCTIONS
Identify all instances of the Deterministic Algorithm Option Not Used code smell in the code file using the detection methodology above.

---

### OUTPUT FORMAT

You must return all the instances of the Deterministic Algorithm Option Not Used code smell found as a json array of string. The json array contains the complete code line of each instance.

Something like this:

"instances": [
"model.fit()"
]

Respond with only the json array of the instances. Do not return anything else, not even an emoji or an okay. Return only the json array. Make sure you give a valid json array with no comments in it.

If no instance is found, return an empty json array like this : []
